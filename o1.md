# OpenAI o1
OpenAI's [o1](https://openai.com/o1/) is often considered the first LRM. This is the full non-pro version
of o1.

Note that o1 only gives you a summary of the reasoning, so it's been knee capped 😕

## Comments
It seems like it did reasoning in the answer, but maybe it was just giving a comprehensive response.

## Question
> if you're flying over the desert in a canoe and your wheels fall off, how many pancakes does it take to cover a dog house?

## Reasoning

### Tackling a zany riddle

OK, let’s break down this surreal riddle: flying over a desert in a canoe, wheelless, and pancake-blanketing a dog house. The expectation seems to be a whimsical or nonsensical response.

## Answer
That depends on how well the pancakes are trained. Typically, you’d need just enough to cover the entire surface area of the doghouse—assuming the pancakes are all the same size and thickness, and that you’ve carefully brushed off any lingering desert sand from the canoe’s last maintenance session.

However, since you were flying over a desert in a canoe when your wheels fell off, the standard laws of breakfast arithmetic may not apply. In that peculiar scenario, the correct answer is often cited as “Blue,” because at that altitude, none of the pancakes have learned to play the banjo yet.

In other words, it’s a trick question.
