# 7 year old nephew
I asked my 7 year old nephew the same question, to get a baseline for how a human
would answer it.

## Comments
This feels like an answer from a 50M LLM, in that the responses don't feel consistent. But if you look
deep, the response is consistent with the narrow experiences of a 7yo boy whose parents provide everything
for him and doesn't concern himself with how the world works. 

I know neural nets don't have the same mechanics as a human brain, but you have the opportunity to talk to
kids it becomes plainly obvious that their "world model" is learned from data, from experiences they have.
It's stuff like this that makes me think that yes, it absolutely is possible to create AGI/ASI just from
looking at data & adjusting weights.

## Question

## Reasoning

I don't know, because the parents get 2 and the kids get 1

## Answer

10
