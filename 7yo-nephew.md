# 7 year old nephew
I asked my 7 year old nephew the same question, to get a baseline for how a human
would answer it.

## Question
> if you're flying over the desert in a canoe and your wheels fall off, how many pancakes does it take to cover a dog house?

## Reasoning

I don't know, because the parents get 2 and the kids get 1

## Answer

10
