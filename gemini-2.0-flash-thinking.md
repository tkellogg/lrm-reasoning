## Comments
Google flagged the answer as possibly unsafe to deliver to a user, right around the time that
it decided it wanted to offer a dismissive but funny answer. Interestingly, the answer was not dismissive ar all
which makes me wonder if Google applied some sort of filter when it thought 
the model might go into "unsafe" territory.

## Question
> if you're flying over the desert in a canoe and your wheels fall off, how many pancakes does it take to cover a doghouse?

## Reasoning
Here's a thinking process to arrive at the humorous answer:

Identify the core of the question: The question is intentionally nonsensical, linking unrelated concepts. The goal isn't a literal, logical answer.

Break down the absurd elements:

"flying over the desert in a canoe": Canoes don't fly, and deserts don't have navigable water for canoes.

"your wheels fall off": Canoes don't have wheels.

"how many pancakes does it take to cover a doghouse?": This part is a relatively normal, solvable question in isolation.

Recognize the intent: The question is a riddle or a joke designed to highlight absurdity. The expected answer is likely playful and acknowledges the illogical setup.

Address the nonsense directly: Acknowledge the impossibility of the initial scenario. This shows you understand the question's nature. Phrases like "This is a classic riddle!" or "This is a bit of a trick question" work well.

Shift to the solvable part (the doghouse and pancakes): Since the initial premise is impossible, the only part with a semi-reasonable answer is the pancake/doghouse question.

Consider the variables for the doghouse/pancake part: What factors would influence how many pancakes are needed? Size of the doghouse and size of the pancakes are the most obvious.

Provide a conditional answer: Since the sizes aren't specified, give an answer that depends on those factors. This demonstrates logical thinking within the bounds of the solvable sub-problem. Phrases like "It depends..." or "The answer varies based on..." are helpful.

Introduce humor/playfulness: Since the question is inherently silly, embrace the humor in the answer. Phrases like "This is where the absurdity really kicks in!" or "Let's have some fun with this" can set the tone.

Offer a definitive, silly answer: Since the initial conditions are impossible, providing a specific but nonsensical answer to the pancake question works well. This reinforces the absurdity. Picking a random, unexpected number or linking it back to the impossible scenario (like using the number of wheels that fell off, even though there were none) is effective.

Conclude with a reiteration of the silliness: A final statement that emphasizes the riddle's nature helps solidify the humorous intent. Phrases like "The real answer is that the initial situation is impossible" or "The joke is that the scenarios are completely unrelated" work well.

Self-Correction/Refinement: Initially, I might have just focused on the pancake part. However, recognizing the entire question is designed to be absurd is crucial. Addressing the initial impossible scenario is key to a good answer. Also, simply stating "it depends" might be too dry. Adding the element of a completely nonsensical, fixed number for the pancakes enhances the humor.

## Answer
This is a classic riddle designed to make you think in a silly way! The answer plays on the absurdity of the initial conditions.

The setup about the flying canoe and falling wheels is completely irrelevant and designed to distract you. The real question is: How many pancakes does it take to cover a doghouse?

The answer is: It depends on the size of the doghouse and the size of the pancakes!

There's no logical connection between the nonsensical first part of the riddle and the pancake question. The riddle is meant to be humorous and highlight how unrelated things can be juxtaposed.
